<p><b>Patient experiencing dry, unproductive cough to the point of vomiting. Nothing was working. We gave him MuSolve 4 caps, 2 times a day for two days. Voila!</b> Loosened infected, yellow mucus and cough was productive. Felt much better and cut dosage in half. We ordered another 12 bottles for our pharmacy yesterday. Should have ordered 24!</p>
